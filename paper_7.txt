No, do not think
of the solitary tear, the broken limb,
the rubble-strewn home, the choking scream;
never think
of piled up bodies, blazing flames,
shattered lives, or sundered souls.
Do not think of the triumph of the torturer,
the wails of the hungry,
the screams of the mutilated,
or the indifferent smirk
of the sleek.

Think of nothing.
then you will be able
to sleep. 

Throughout history, the specter of human rights violations has loomed ominously over societies, unveiling the deepest recesses of human depravity.  Incomprehensible acts of violence, discrimination, and oppression have etched a somber narrative of anguish, permeating the very fabric of our collective consciousness.  Think of the Jews who were persecuted throughout Europe for centuries,  the Africans who were forcibly displaced by the Transatlantic Slave Trade across the Americas and the Caribbean,  or the more recent tragedies of Armenians,  and Palestinians,  who have been deprived of a homeland and suffered genocide.  Specifically, an increasing number of “refugee diasporas” have emerged, wherein individuals are compelled by conflict or persecution to flee their ancestral lands and homes, to which they hold deep political, economic, and cultural ties. 
It is in response to these dark moments in human history that the concept of international human rights law emerged as a beacon of hope, seeking to restore dignity, justice, and equality to all individuals, regardless of their racial, religious, or national identities.  Guided by the principles of universality and indivisibility, it strives to protect and uphold the fundamental rights and freedoms of every human being.  However, the South Asian experience stands testament to the evolving nature of such legal recourse for refugee diasporas,  with the international community failing on its obligation to effectively intervene and adjudicate instances of human rights violations:  

In the beginning, there were two nations. One was a vast, mighty and magnificent empire, brilliantly organized and culturally unified, which dominated a massive swath of the earth. The other was an undeveloped, semifeudal realm, riven by religious factionalism and barely able to feed its illiterate, diseased, and stinking masses. The first nation was [Hindustan]. The second was England…  [Years later], the sun never set on the British empire… because even God couldn’t trust the Englishman in the dark…  [Under their rule], all that [was] solid melt[ed] into air, all that [was] holy [was] profaned, and [the Indian] man [was] at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind. 

The year 1947 stands as a pivotal moment in human history, marking a transformative shift in the legal landscape with the Partition of Hindustan.  This seismic event brought about a profound change in the region’s borders, as the dissolution of the British Raj gave birth to two newly independent and sovereign dominions: India and Pakistan, each with its own distinct character and ambitions.  However, it was not without catastrophic consequences for the people of Hindustan.  The Partition unleashed a paroxysm of fratricidal slaughter and sparked the greatest mass migration ever witnessed by humanity.  The conflagration of burning communal hate that ensued claimed a staggering excess mortality of approximately three million people, and forced anywhere from 14 million to 18 million to seek refuge.  It is in contemplating the experiences of this “refugee diaspora” that we can ponder the implications of the Partition within the neo-Westphalian era.  In what follows, I will offer various philosophical, jurisprudential, and legal analyses of international human rights to determine the role that the British Government played in the violations that occurred during the Partition. Ultimately examining how this case might be adjudicated, I argue that the British Government ought to have been held liable for its role in dismantling a nation, and how it is incumbent upon them to mete out reparations for genocide and crimes against humanity. 
Prima facie, it is crucial to distinguish between the “myth of the Partition,” and what actually transpired in the years preceding it.  Under British rule, the notion of an unsolvable dichotomy between Hindus and Muslims in Hindustan was widely accepted, but it is “deeply flawed, and reveals more about the colonialist mindset and insecurity than it does about the restless subjects of the Raj themselves.”  The very concept of two cohesive groups of Hindu and Muslim co-religionists is profoundly erroneous, and “does a great disservice to the wide range of cultural, linguistic, ethnic, and religious differences” that existed within these groups who lived across the vast Indian subcontinent before 1947.  This reductionist myth also ignores the multitude of other communities that comprised the rich tapestry of Hindustani society, including Jains, Sikhs, Christians, Jews, Buddhists, tribal groups, and countless others.  Moreover, the notion that the British Raj played the role of impartial “arbiter between warring groups” during the Partition is belied by their own culpability in fueling local animosity and “nationwide grievances, as part of their colonial strategy of divide and rule.” 
In 1523, political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli posited the notion of “divide and rule” as a strategic policy involving the creation of discord among groups to prevent the formation of alliances that might pose a threat to the sovereign power,  supporting those who are willing to cooperate with the sovereign,  sowing seeds of distrust and hostility among communal leaders,  and encouraging pointless expenditures to weaken political and military capabilities as part of “imperial defense.”  Indian scholars like Shashi Tharoor have demonstrated that the British Raj employed this tactic time and time again to solidify their authority and suppress the emergence of the Indian Independence Movement,  citing Lord Elphinstone, who stated that “Divide et impera was the old Roman maxim, and it should be ours.”  Further, in 2013, the Indian jurist and proponent of Hindustani reunification, Markandey Katju, expressed the traditional nationalist stance in an article for the Pakistani newspaper The Nation:

Up to 1857, there were no communal problems in India; all communal riots and animosity began after 1857. No doubt even before 1857, there were differences between Hindus and Muslims, the Hindus going to temples and the Muslims going to mosques, but there was no animosity. In fact, the Hindus and Muslims used to help each other; Hindus used to participate in Eid celebrations, and Muslims in Holi and Diwali. The Muslim rulers like the Mughals, Nawab of Awadh, and Murshidabad, Tipu Sultan, etc. were totally secular; they organized Ramlilas, participated in Holi, Diwali, etc. Ghalib’s affectionate letters to his Hindu friends like Munshi Shiv Narain Aram, Har Gopal Tofta, etc. attest to the affection between Hindus and Muslims at that time. In 1857, the ‘Great Mutiny’ broke out in which the Hindus and Muslims jointly fought against the British. This shocked the British government so much that after suppressing the Mutiny, they decided to start the policy of divide and rule… All communal riots began after 1857, artificially engineered by the British authorities. The British collector would secretly call the Hindu Pandit, pay him money, and tell him to speak against Muslims, and similarly he would secretly call the Maulvi, pay him money, and tell him to speak against Hindus. This communal poison was injected into our body politic year after year and decade after decade. 

In 1909, for instance, the ‘Minto-Morley Reforms’ were introduced, heralding a new era of political maneuvering in the Indian subcontinent.  The resulting divisions sowed the seeds of communalism, with the insidious notion that Hindi was the language of Hindus, while Urdu was reserved for Muslims, despite the fact that it was the lingua franca for all educated people, regardless of religion or ethnicity, until the eve of Partition.  Such baseless propaganda culminated in Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s recognition of religion as a determinant of Indian Muslims’ national identity, which birthed the notion of a pseudo-theocratic nation called Pakistan among the Muslim League that he led.  However, even Jinnah expressed opposition toward the Partition of Punjab and Bengal, and ardently advocated for the unification of the entire region into Pakistan, without any forced displacement of its inhabitants, irrespective of their religious beliefs, be they Sikh or Hindu. 
In August of 1940, however, the former Viceroy Lord Linlithgow suggested that India be granted “Dominion” status following the end of World War II.  Linlithgow, “not having Pakistan seriously,” assumed that Jinnah merely sought a “non-federal” arrangement that did not involve Hindu domination.  To ease the anxieties of Muslims regarding Hindu supremacy, the August Offer was accompanied by a pledge that the perspectives of minorities would be taken into account in a future Constitution.  However, neither the Congress nor the Muslim League were content with this offer, and both rejected it that September.  In August of 1942, the Congress launched the Quit India Resolution in an act of civil disobedience, demanding significant constitutional reforms that the British viewed as the “most serious threat to their rule since the Indian Rebellion of 1857.”  With their resources already thinly stretched by the World War, the British authorities hastily imprisoned the Congress’ leaders, who remained incarcerated until 1945;  the Muslim League was effectively free to spread its “two-nation theory” over the next three years.  
Following the historic general elections of 1945 in England, the Labour Party emerged victorious;  Prime Minister Clement Attlee and Parliamentarians Stafford Cripps and Lord Pethick-Lawrence announced their intention to transfer power to India no later than June 1950, as they “feared that post-war Britain could no longer afford to sustain an expansive empire.”  Still, the British Government did not approve of the idea of creating a separate Muslim homeland.  Instead, they crafted the Cabinet Mission Plan, which sought to preserve a united India, while simultaneously “honoring the essence of Jinnah’s demand for a Pakistan” by creating “groupings” of provinces based on religion.  Although the implementation of this plan would have preserved the unity of Hindustan, Congress leaders feared that it would weaken the center.  In July 1946, the leader of the Congress Party and India’s would-be-first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru gave a stirring and “provocative” speech rejecting the Cabinet Mission Plan, warning that such a transition would result in a “disastrous civil war;”  this “effectively torpedoed” British ambitions. 
To mitigate against Hindustani opposition, Lord Mountbatten arrived in India as the new Viceroy in March 1947, with a “explicit mandate” to transfer power before the expedited date of June 1948.  Despite Congress’ subsequent agreement to the Pakistan demand, Jinnah remained adamant.  He held six meetings with Mountbatten and insisted on six full provinces, complaining that dividing Punjab and Bengal would result in a “moth-eaten Pakistan.”  Finally, in June 1947, nationalist leaders, including Nehru and Jinnah, agreed to a division of the country, with predominantly Hindu and Sikh areas assigned to India, and predominantly Muslim areas to Pakistan, including a relegation of the Muslim-majority provinces of Punjab and Bengal.  Sardar Vallabhai Patel approved the proposal, and alongside Mountbatten, lobbied political ethicist and lawyer Mohandas Karamchand “Mahatma” Gandhi in private meetings to persuade him out of his opposition to the Partition.  On July 2, 1947, Mountbatten even wrote to Attlee, “my private opinion is that Gandhi is adopting his usual Trotsky[esque] attitude and might quite well like to see the present plan wrecked, so he is busy stiffening Congress’ attitude.” 
Seeing no alternative in the face of an imminent transfer of power except by abrogating his duties and partitioning Hindustan, Mountbatten appointed Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a lawyer with no prior experience in South Asia, to head the Boundary Commission tasked with drawing the borders between India and Pakistan.  Radcliffe arrived in India on July 8, 1947, and was given a mere 39 days to complete the boundary maps in consultation with local social and political representatives.  He had no knowledge of the complex religious, cultural, and linguistic differences that existed between the various regions in India, but proceeded to divide the nation based on outdated census data and old blueprints, all the while maintaining secrecy “to avoid disputes and delays.” 
Ultimately, the Radcliffe Line demarcated Indian and Pakistani territory according to religion by fracturing Punjab and Bengal, two provinces with deeply mixed populations, and continued its unyielding course through Jammu and Kashmir, where a Muslim-majority populace was ruled by a Hindu Maharaja.  Radcliffe left the decision of whether to accede to India or Pakistan to the ruler himself, who chose to remain independent.  Today, Kashmir remains in a state of perpetual violence and unrest, as both India and Pakistan continue warring over it.  Radcliffe justified his ultimate “casual division with the truism that no matter what he did, people would suffer,”  and subsequently “destroyed all his papers before he left India.” 
Formalized by the Indian Independence Act of 1947, the official Partition entailed the division of a wide range of assets between India and Pakistan, from the British Indian Army to the central treasury, the railways, and the Indian Civil Service.  Additionally, the Act provided for the creation of a Constituent Assembly in each country that would be responsible for drafting a new Constitution, but the implementation of this provision was marred by confusion and haste.  The Assembly, which had previously been tasked with drafting a Constitution for a unified Hindustan, was left with the additional challenge of delineating power between the Union and state governments after decolonization.  The unprecedented Radcliffe Line further complicated matters, forcing the Assembly to grapple with how to represent the interests of Hindustan’s diverse linguistic, religious, and cultural groups.  Moreover, given that the two countries gained independence at midnight on 14 and 15 August 1947 respectively, the implementation of the Radcliffe Award was just as rushed.  Representatives of the fledgling governments were granted only two hours to review copies of the maps before their publication on 17 August 1947, leaving millions of citizens in a state of limbo. 
As anticipated, this was accompanied by a surge of communal violence: Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs succumbed to a “bloodthirsty frenzy,” as violence and savagery surged through the land.  The number of refugees swelled rapidly, with columns numbering in the tens of thousands, whose arduous journeys were rife with unspeakable suffering and unimaginable hardships.  Many were plagued by hunger, homelessness, and epidemics, which disproportionately afflicted the elderly and the young, while wanton attacks by marauding bands compounded the already dire situation.  Even those who managed to secure transportation by train, truck, or airplane, were not always guaranteed safety, as convoys were often waylaid, and passengers massacred.  In the process, families were torn apart, never to see each other again.  Partition scholars Ian Talbot and Gurharpal Singh portray the atrocities as follows:

There are numerous eyewitness accounts of the maiming and mutilation of victims. The catalogue of horrors includes the disemboweling of pregnant women, the slamming of babies’ heads against brick walls, the cutting off of the victim’s limbs and genitalia, and the displaying of heads and corpses. While previous communal riots had been deadly, the scale and level of brutality during the Partition massacres were unprecedented. Although some scholars question the use of the term ‘genocide’ concerning the Partition massacres, much of the violence was manifested with genocidal tendencies. It was designed to cleanse an existing generation and prevent its future reproduction. 

It is evident, then, that the inherent human rights of millions of Hindustanis were violated as a result of the British Partition of India in 1947. 
Of course, today, we have a number of conventions that have codified these rights of citizens around the world into international law. The most fundamental of these is the Rome Statute, a treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is a permanent international court that has the jurisdiction to prosecute individuals, corporations, non-governmental organizations, intergovernmental organizations, and states for violations of fundamental human rights,  specifically genocide,  crimes against humanity,  war crimes,  and the crime of aggression.  Genocide is the intentional and systematic destruction of a specific ethnic, racial, religious, or national group, which Sayantani Jana and several other historians have identified the Partition to have been a case of;  the crimes against humanity in question include the forcible transfer of population, the persecution of religious identity groups, and sexual violence against women and children.  The Rome Statute was signed in 1998 and ratified by 60 states by 2002, when it was executed.  As of 2023, 123 countries are party to the treaty, excluding the United States, Russia, and China. 
Of course, there are a number of other international conventions that have codified human rights that are relevant to the case at hand, including Article 39 of the United Nations Charter;  Articles 6,  7,  9,  12,  and 17,  of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; Articles 6,  22,  and 39,  of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; Articles I,  II,  III,  and IV,  of the Geneva Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women;  and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  However, given that (a) the Partition occurred in 1947, and (b) Hindustan was a colony at the time,  not a state, i.e., (i) it did not have a defined unified territory,  (ii) the ability to protect itself,  (iii) a stable population,  (iv) a consolidated entity that could exercise the functions of government,  and (v) was not recognized by the international community by way of treaties;  Hindustan could not have been a party to these conventions. 
This does not indicate that nations or states that have not yet ratified the Rome Statute or other treaties are absolved from persecution if they were to commit one of the aforementioned human rights violations. We know, today, that conventions written in blackletter are not the only sources of international law.  Article 38 (b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) specifically articulates that “international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law” can be used to determine legal obligations in the international community in lieu of treaties.  Customary international law are those “rule[s] of comity,” that when upheld for centuries, “grow by the general assent of civilized nations into a settled… international law,” as seen in the case of the Paquete Habana.  For instance, British common law had proscribed murder and forcible displacement for decades before the Partition, holding that a person’s right to remain on their property was inviolable;  any attempt to displace them, then, would constitute a violation of their fundamental human rights, and was punishable by law. 
So, too, are these rights established by “the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations,” as outlined in Article 38 (c) of the ICJ Statute.  All 193 states in the world are party to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, wherein Article 53 specifically articulates that “jus cogens” peremptory norms are “accepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole as norm[s] from which no derogation is permitted.”  Thus, even if a state has not ratified the Rome Statute, it is both legally bound by and obligated to follow in accordance with it, because the peremptory norms reflect the principle of law of ‘justice;’  thereby providing a legal framework for the prosecution of genocide and crimes against humanity. 
Finally, according to Article 38 (d) of the ICJ Statute, the “teachings of the most highly qualified publicists” serve as “subsidiary means for the determination of [these] rules of law.”  Father of international law Hugo Grotius first proposed the notion of rights derived from natural law that humans possess by the very nature of their humanity.  Political philosopher John Locke extended this to identify, in his Second Treatise, that all humans are inherently equal, and thus possess the natural rights of life, liberty, bodily integrity, and property.  In accordance with the law of nature, i.e., reason,  individuals realize they cannot protect these rights on their own.  They subsequently contract into civil society,  wherein they divulge their absolute freedom of being their own judge, jury, and executioner, when someone violates these natural rights, unto a democratic government.  In accordance with jurisprudential scholar Wesley Hohfeld’s legal framework, insofar as citizens possess these rights, i.e., claims they can articulate in court, their government has a correlative duty to secure them.  Conversely, governments can be held accountable for failing on this obligation. 
The ICC is one such institution that can try states for failing to uphold the protections of fundamental human rights insofar as they do not take measures to prevent or punish genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, or the crime of aggression.  This is because there is an important distinction to be made between state responsibility for such atrocities on the one hand, and individual criminal responsibility on the other.  Whereas individuals can be prosecuted and held accountable for their participation in such activities, it is not a state function to engage in them.  Thus, it is through the prosecution of individuals, including those acting on behalf of the state, that the ICC aims to promote justice, deter future crimes, and uphold the principles of international law. 
Importantly, while the ICC is an independent judicial body, it serves as a complementary court, which means that it only intervenes when national courts are unable or unwilling to prosecute these atrocities.  In lieu of the ICC, an international tribunal would need to have been established to serve in a similar capacity.  This tribunal would have had the jurisdiction and authority to investigate and prosecute individuals responsible for the grave violations of human rights committed during the Partition, and would entail several considerations. Firstly, it would provide a forum for impartial and independent proceedings, free from any potential biases or conflicts of interest that might exist within national courts.  This would enhance the credibility and legitimacy of the judicial process, ensuring that justice is served, and victims’ rights are upheld.  Secondly, it would enable a comprehensive and systematic examination of the atrocities committed.  It would have the resources and expertise to gather evidence, conduct thorough investigations, and bring to light the truth about the events that took place.  This truth-seeking process is essential for acknowledging the stories of the victims, promoting historical reconciliation, and preventing the repetition of similar crimes in the future.  Lastly, an international tribunal would play a significant role in providing redress and reparations to the victims and their families.  It would have the authority to order “restitution, compensation, and rehabilitation,”  aiming to restore the dignity and rights of those affected by the genocide and crimes against humanity that took place in Hindustan.
In the case of the Partition, the establishment of an international tribunal assumes heightened significance, considering the potential reluctance of national courts in India and Pakistan to undertake prosecution. Several factors could contribute to this unwillingness, including the historical context of a former colonial power’s involvement, existing political conflicts between the two states, intimidation tactics employed, and the fear of facing adverse consequences or backlash from conducting such a trial. It is also possible that the national courts might have faced limitations in effectively prosecuting these crimes, given (a) the absence and inadequacy of their judicial institutions at the time,  and (b) the complexities arising from the dispersion of the victims across multiple countries, which include but are not limited to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. 
At the tribunal, then, it is particularly relevant to examine the trajectory of international duties for the purpose of determining what, if any obligations, the British Government had toward Hindustanis. Following the Thirty Years’ War from 1618 to 1648, states became the dominant actors in the Westphalian international system;  the Treaties of Westphalia recognized federal governments as the supreme and exclusive authorities within their borders.  Upon the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British East India Company had thus transferred administrative control to the British Crown by way of the Government of India Act of 1858.  Shortly thereafter, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to the “Princes, Chiefs, and People of India,” stating that

… we hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligation of duty which bind us to all our other subjects; and these obligations by the blessing of Almighty God we shall faithfully and conscientiously fulfill. 

As such, India was a British colony under its jurisdiction and as part of its sovereign territory for nearly a century. 
However, World War II marked the rise of the Neo-Westphalian era, because the world recognized that absolute sovereignty had helped shield the Nazi Holocaust,  which claimed the lives of six million Jews and entailed unimaginable atrocities on human rights.  Since no international organization or state could intercede without violating the principles of non-intervention and self-determination, Adolf Hitler had a “free hand” in genocide and crimes against humanity.  The principle of responsible sovereignty thus emerged: the notion that sovereignty entails a state’s legal obligation to protect its citizens.  It is of paramount importance to note the state of affairs in Hindustan following this shift. India and Pakistan had gained independence in 1947, but it was not until 26 January 1950 and 14 August 1973 that the Constitutions of the two newly formed countries went into effect respectively.  In the interim, they underwent a tumultuous period of political and social upheaval.  They did not have functional institutions; in fact, they had the complete opposite: no consolidated government, no established bureaucracy or military, and effectively no legal structure.  As such, they were nominally “states” in 1947, and would not gain such status in any real capacity until many years later. 
In accordance with the Hohfeldian framework, Indian and Pakistani leaders’ lack of legitimate authority and infrastructural resources resulted in their absence of power to protect their citizenry post 1947.  This gave rise to the disability of the Hindustani people, i.e., their deprivation in their natural rights of life, liberty, bodily integrity, and property.  As was the case in Sarhan v. Holder,  insofar as the refugees lacked the means and ability to protect themselves, yet were “out of the bounds of civil society,” Locke suggests that they would have reverted to an apparent state of nature.  At best, then, the Partition was plagued by insecurity.  At its worst, however, political theorist Thomas Hobbes suggests that it would have been “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short,”  with Hindustanis existing in a condition of “continuall feare, and danger of violent death” from the “war of every man against every man.”  As such, it was incumbent upon the British Government, the official authority at the time, to (a) secure a peaceful transfer of power, and (b) protect the natural rights of Hindustanis. 
At the time, British authority was vested in the Viceroy Lord Mountbatten, “an official who reign[ed] over a polity in the name of and as the representative of the monarch of the territory.”  This notion of authorization owes its genesis to Hobbes,  according to whom just as people transfer their natural right of self-preservation to the sovereign Leviathan in exchange for protection and security via the social contract;  so, too, may that entity authorize another to act on its behalf.  This authorization, then, confers powers upon the personified;  as was the case with Attlee authorizing Mountbatten to represent Britain in India, wherein the Prime Minister’s executive and legislative power was conferred upon the Viceroy.  Importantly, such authorization also imposes duties and responsibilities upon the personified entity.  So, insofar as Mountbatten was acting in the official capacity of the state while organizing the Independence and Partition of Hindustan, he was bound by the British Government’s aforementioned duties.
To better understand the consequences of abrogating these duties, an analysis of negligence is in order. In The Common Law, jurisprudential scholar Oliver Wendell Holmes introduced a four-part standard for negligence, a fundamental aspect of tort and criminal law.  The first element is duty, which includes any legal obligations that an official has, as well as their responsibility to act with reasonable care.  The reasonableness criteria entails whether the official considered the burden of taking precautions, the likelihood of harm, and the seriousness of the harm that might result from their actions.  “The failure to use such care as a reasonably prudent and careful person would use under similar circumstances,” then, constitutes a part of negligent behavior.  The second element is a breach of duty, where the official either violated their legal obligations or did not act with reasonable care.  Causation is the third factor, which requires a causal relationship to be established between the breach of duty and any harm that occurred.  The fourth and final component of negligence is damages, which accounts for whether or not someone is entitled to compensation or relief as a result of the official’s behavior, such as for pain and suffering, lost wages or infrastructure, medical costs, and the like. 
On each of these counts, it is evident that Sir Cyril Radcliffe was negligent. However, to better understand this, we must examine the specific actions taken and powers exercised by Mountbatten during his time in office, where he was acting in the official capacity of the state. First and foremost, the Viceroy arranged the Indian Independence Act of 1947, which was subsequently executed by the Parliament.  As such, he seems to have met the obligation of decolonizing Hindustan.  However, “the argument that quick transfer of power could be possible on Dominion Status basis only is… fallacious or specious.”  As we have previously established, India and Pakistan did not have functional institutions till many years after independence, and the period of time before their respective Constitutions went into effect was marked by widespread political instability.  The communal leaders “seemed totally helpless,” and desperately sought to fan the flames of religious and sectarian differences, all the while seeking legitimate authority.  Of course, in the absence of a formalized structure of governance, no real transfer of power was possible. 
As such, it is evident that Mountbatten breached his first duty. A clear causal relationship can be drawn between his actions in the months preceding the Partition and the harm that resulted: had he not “allowed barely 73 days to complete this stupendous and complex operation [that] affect[ed] the destinies of millions,” but instead, patiently developed a way forward in consultation with local leaders, as one exercising reasonable care might have, the extent of resulting harm could have been prevented;  in which case, his behavior on this count was negligent.
Whether or not Mountbatten met his second duty of safeguarding the natural rights of Hindustanis, though, has been the subject of much controversy.  Yet, it has long been established that several warnings about the potential for violence were conveyed to Mountbatten before the Partition.  In August 1946, for instance, the Viceroy’s own Chief of Staff Hastings Ismay warned him that “the consequences of hasty withdrawal from India could be appalling,” and that “there would be serious communal trouble.”  In response, Mountbatten reportedly brushed off the concerns and said that he had been given “a free hand” to handle the situation as he saw fit.  Then, in February 1947, the former Viceroy Lord Wavell cautioned that the Partition could lead to a “very considerable amount of bloodshed and disorder.”  In May 1947, Sir Evan Jenkins, the Governor of Punjab, predicted that the Partition could result in “a grave danger of civil war.”  In June 1947, too, the Indian civil servant V. P. Menon and Muslim leader Maulana Azad warned Mountbatten that the Partition would repeat “a holocaust of unparalleled magnitude” and that “Punjab and Bengal [would] run with blood” respectively.  Mountbatten subsequently responded as such:

At least on this one question I shall give you complete assurance. I shall see to it that there is no bloodshed and riot… Once Partition is accepted in principle, I shall issue orders to see that there is no communal disturbance anywhere in the country. If there should be the slightest agitation, I shall adopt the sternest measures to nip the trouble in the bud… I will order the Army and the Air Force to act, and I shall use tanks and aeroplanes to suppress anybody who wants to create trouble. 

Despite these warnings and his promises, Mountbatten pressed ahead. The refugee crisis that ensued, then, was directly caused by (a) the Indian Independence Act of 1947, which forcibly transferred Hindu and Muslim populations into separate countries,  and (b) the Radcliffe Line, which was based on outdated census data and obsolete cartography, as well as failed to account for the cultural diversity in Hindustan at the time.  It is evident that he breached his second duty on account of failing to protect the natural rights of Hindustanis, as well as meeting the criteria of reasonable care, just as Radcliffe did in creating a defective map. The damages sought would include infrastructure, compensation, and relief for the mass displacement of people against their will (especially in Punjab and Bengal), religious persecution, communal violence, the loss of life and property, and billions of dollars’ worth of medical costs for victims, not to mention the immense trauma and suffering of those separated from their families and loved ones.  Thus, the harm that resulted from the breach of duty was not limited to tort injuries, but rather, went to the extent of violating the fundamental human rights of Hindustanis;  in which case, Mountbatten was complicit in genocide and crimes against humanity.
Now, it is important to note that Hobbes’ notion of authorization entails that the responsibility of state functions performed by the authorized party lies not only with the authority on whose behalf they are acting, but also with the authorized party themselves.  This is consistent with Hohfeld’s view, wherein a liability refers to a legal consequence that arises to hold an organization accountable for the actions taken by its officials.  Then, insofar as Mountbatten was acting in the official capacity of the state, his exercise of power would be correlative to the British government’s liability.  As such, his failure to uphold his duties by way of negligent behavior rendered them culpable for the harm resulting from the Partition violence and its aftermath.
Jurisprudential scholar Joseph Beale has written extensively on both tortious and criminal liability, drawing an important distinction between natural and proximate causes of action.  Natural cause-in-fact entails an immediate factor or event that directly leads to a particular outcome;  by extension, the party that is responsible for the natural cause is directly liable for the harm that resulted from it.  Proximate cause means that it was reasonably foreseeable for the act or omission thereof in question to have led to harm.  This can be established either by demonstrating that a party authorized an official to perform a certain act, or by showing that the party “knew or should have known” that harm was likely to occur as a result.  In both cases, if the party could have acted otherwise to prevent the harm from taking place, or mitigate its extent, they can be held vicariously liable for the official’s negligence. 
Such was the case in Doe v. Unocal Corp., wherein seventeen anonymous villagers from the Tenasserim region in Myanmar filed suit against Unocal Corporation, an American oil and gas company, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  The plaintiffs alleged that Unocal had provided financial and logistical support of equipment, transportation, and other resources, to the Burmese military, effectively aiding and abetting in their violations of human rights during the construction of the Yadana gas pipeline.  They also alleged that Unocal had knowingly benefited from the military’s use of forced labor and other abusive practices, such as burning villages, raping women, and engaging in the extrajudicial killing of villagers in an attempt to suppress local opposition to the project.  Ultimately, the Court ruled in the villagers’ favor, granting them declaratory and injunctive relief.  Important for our purposes is its definitive finding of Unocal as vicariously liable based on Beale’s aforementioned conditions of proximate cause, wherein the corporation “knew or should have known” about the crimes against humanity being committed, and thereby could have taken measures to prevent them had they exercised reasonable care. 
Understanding this, and taking into consideration the Viceroy Lord Mountbatten’s negligent behavior, we can begin to examine the British Government’s liability. As part of the 1946 Cabinet Mission Plan, the British Government established a task force to undertake a comprehensive risk assessment of the potential consequences of Partition.  It found that the geographical division of Hindustan would likely result in significant social, political, and religious tensions, and lead to widespread violence and mass displacement.  Subsequently, in June 1947, Nehru alerted English officials that “the whole of India [would] become a battlefield.”  As such, “even [Prime Minister] Attlee was taken by surprise and was ‘shocked’ by [Mountbatten’s] announcement [of the expedited date of Partition].”  Still, he claimed to “trust [Mountbatten’s] judgment,” and did not hesitate in supporting his decision. 
In fact, the British Government proceeded to provide Mountbatten with the “necessary resources” for implementing the Partition of Hindustan.  Upon visiting Lahore towards the end of August 1947, for instance, the Viceroy quickly realized the urgent need to maintain law and order in the region.  To that end, he arranged for the formation of the Punjab Boundary Force in consultation with the British Government to prevent further violence and bloodshed.  However, the size of the territory and the sheer number of people affected by the Partition meant that the Force, which consisted of a mere 50,000 men, was spread thin: less than one soldier was available per square mile.  This inadequate presence of security measures was unable to prevent the widespread killings that occurred in rural areas, which accounted for 77% of the total death toll.  The predicament was made worse by the fact that the Boundary Force was unable to protect the cities, let alone the countless caravans of refugees who were fleeing their homes in what would soon become Pakistan. 
So, the British Government was not the natural cause-in-fact of the violence that took place during the Partition. Rather, it was a result of religious infighting. Of course, the tensions between Hindus and Muslims would not have risen to the extent of mass murder if it were not for the British colonial policy of “divide and rule,”  but even if that consideration were to be discounted, the British Government definitively possessed prior knowledge of the potential for violence and unrest.  Moreover, they had the ability and authority to mete out resources to prevent or mitigate the extent of the same.  It is clear, then, that they met Beale’s standard of proximate cause and power to act otherwise;  in which case, they ought to have been held vicariously liable for the genocide that occurred during the Partition.  Importantly, as aforementioned, while Mountbatten can be prosecuted and held accountable for his proximate participation in genocide, the British Government can only be held accountable to its duty to prevent and punish such behavior, because it was not a legitimate state-sanctioned function. 
In terms of the forcible transfer of population, the British Government was the natural cause-in-fact. Had they not partitioned the country, but rather, simply granted Hindustan its independence; or, had the Partition not been so hastily implemented, but rather, given its due time by working with local leaders, the massive displacement of people and the resulting violence could have been entirely prevented or at the very least, significantly mitigated.  The decision to divide the region along religious lines and the hurried execution of the Partition without adequate preparations exacerbated religious persecution in a foreseeably volatile situation, leading to widespread suffering, loss of life, and deprivation of property.  Moreover, the British Government met Beale’s standard of power to act otherwise;  in which case, they ought to have been held directly liable for neither preventing nor punishing crimes against humanity that occurred during the Partition. 
It might be the case, of course, that the Viceroy Lord Mountbatten claim a defense to avoid criminal culpability. He might suggest that insofar as he was authorized to organize the Independence and Partition of Hindustan in 1947, he was acting within the scope of his duties. As such, he could invoke immunity based on the argument that he was simply following orders from the British Government, and therefore ought not be held personally accountable for the consequences of the Partition. An immunity, in Hohfeld’s legal framework, refers to the exemption or protection from liability.  It is the condition of being shielded from legal consequences that might otherwise arise from one’s actions, particularly those that are negligent.  Under this conception, he might contend that his exercise of official power entailed his ability to invoke immunity. 
Specifically, given his office of Viceroy, Mountbatten could potentially claim diplomatic immunity, a notion that Grotius first posited in De Jure Belli ac Pacis, i.e., On the Law of War and Peace.  Grotius believed that granting immunity to diplomats was necessary for the proper functioning of governance and the maintenance of peaceful relations between nations.  Without it, they would be vulnerable to harassment, detention, and even execution by the host country, which could lead to political crises, disruptions in important missions, and even war.  Articles 29,  30,  and 31,  of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations have since emerged from his jurisprudence to today be legally binding for the treaty’s signatories. Consequently, Mountbatten might claim that he had the power to negate liability via protection under diplomatic immunity. 
However, it is important to note here that this immunity does not extend to that which protects the violation of fundamental human rights such as genocide and crimes against humanity.  Following the end of World War II, yet years before the Partition, the Nuremberg Principles of 1945 had established a set of guidelines formulated by the International Law Commission of the United Nations to define and codify the legal principles underlying the prosecution of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  These principles were derived from the judgments and proceedings of the Nuremberg trials, which took place from 1945 to 1946, where Nazi officials were prosecuted for their involvement in the Holocaust.  As such, these violations are subject to universal jurisdiction, which means that individuals who commit them can be held accountable regardless of their official positions or any claims of immunity.  Then, Mountbatten’s potential assertion of diplomatic immunity would not absolve him of responsibility for his complicity in the horrors resulting from Partition.
Interestingly, this case might also have been adjudicated in Indian or Pakistani ad hoc courts, had they been willing and able to do so.  These courts would have had original jurisdiction,  as well as subject-matter jurisdiction,  under the “tort exception” to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA),  because domestic courts can exercise jurisdiction over foreign states in cases involving personal injury or death caused by the tortious act of the foreign state or its officials.  Here, too, Mountbatten might invoke the FSIA, which governs the immunity of foreign governments from persecution in domestic courts.  It establishes that states are immune from suits insofar as they are acting in the official capacity of a state.  However, the Court in Letelier v. Republic of Chile found that such immunity extends only insofar as and up until it constitutes the “state-sponsored terrorism” exception.  This provides that a state is not immune from suit if it commits an act that results in terrorism, because such activity is not a legitimate state-sanctioned function.  In the case of the Partition, Mountbatten’s legislation resulted in widespread violence, mass murder, and forcible displacement, which have already been established as crimes against humanity and genocide;  in which case, he could still be held liable. 
Such a consequence aligns with the Protective and Objective territorial theories of law. Under the Protective territorial theory, a country’s legislature is “competent to enact laws” and its courts have jurisdiction to both enforce and execute their laws wherever and by whomever the act is performed.  This would be applicable when the act in question threatens the security of the state or directly interferes with the functions of its government.  The Court in United States v. Columba-Colella held that an act solely affecting a citizen of the state “is not a sufficient basis for that state to assert jurisdiction over the act.”  Conversely, insofar as the act exceeds such scope, domestic courts would be able to exercise jurisdiction.  In the case of Mountbatten’s actions during the Partition, the genocide and crimes against humanity took place within Hindustani territory, directly impacting the functioning of their governments due to a mishandled transfer of power.  Moreover, the threat to the security and well-being of tens of millions of people would have granted Indian and Pakistani courts the jurisdiction to prosecute him for his role in these crimes.
By contrast, the purpose of the Objective territorial theory is not to deter interference with governmental functions, but to adjudicate and regulate measurable effects within the sovereign state.  The theory requires that “before a state may attach criminal consequences to an extraterritorial act,” the act must have a substantial effect within the sovereign state.  In this case, Mountbatten’s actions taken from Britain were rooted in former Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s “conspiracy that contrive[d] India’s tragic, blood-soaked Partition to gain Pakistan as a strategic anti-Soviet ally to protect Persian Gulf oil.”  The event had far-reaching and devastating effects on the people of India and Pakistan, as has been extensively investigated.  Therefore, under the Objective territorial theory, both Indian and Pakistani courts could assert jurisdiction over Mountbatten for his involvement in the crimes against humanity and genocide committed during the Partition.
In any case, adjudication of the violation of these fundamental human rights would entail the international tribunal providing redress to the victims and their families.  In accordance with Article 75 of the Rome Statute, it would have the resources and expertise to investigate and determine the extent of damage caused by the Partition.  The tribunal would also have the power to order “restitution, compensation, and rehabilitation” to address the harm suffered by the victims and their families.  In providing reparations for the purpose of healing and rebuilding affected communities, the court would also be sending a strong message that such crimes will not go unpunished and that the rights of victims will be respected and upheld. 
Here, restitution refers to the act of returning what has been taken or lost.  For victims of the Partition, it would involve actions taken by the British Government to restore the victims and their families to the position they were in before the harm occurred.  This would include returning seized property, compensating for loss of infrastructure or land, and reinstating rights and privileges that were denied or violated in consultation with the Indian and Pakistani governments.  Compensation refers to providing financial or material payment as a form of redress for the harm suffered.  It would be incumbent upon Mountbatten, then, to mete out compensatory justice to the victims of Partition or their families to account for the loss of life and violence, as well as to mitigate the economic losses and material hardships faced by Hindustanis.  Lastly, rehabilitation refers to the process of rebuilding the physical, psychological, and social well-being of individuals and communities affected by the trauma and harm.  This form of restorative justice would include medical and psychological services, counseling, access to education and vocational training, infrastructure for resettlement, and assistance to Hindustanis such that they might reintegrate into society. 
To be sure, the tapestry of international human rights law continues to weave a narrative of progress and redemption in the wake of unspeakable horrors. The echoes of the Partition’s dark legacy, etched in the annals of history as genocide and crimes against humanity, compel us to confront the complexities of jurisdiction and responsibility. The British government, be it a former colonial power, cannot evade scrutiny for the negligence of its officials, whose decisions became the harbingers of untold suffering and anguish. Yet, amidst the depths of despair, the call for reparations resonates as a clarion of hope, demanding a reckoning with how inalienable our human rights are. They embody the ardent desire to reclaim lost dignity, resurrect fractured communities, and forge pathways to reconciliation. It is through the crucible of accountability, the balm of reparations, and an unwavering commitment to justice, that we can design a more equitable and compassionate world, where the victims of past atrocities might find eternal rest.
