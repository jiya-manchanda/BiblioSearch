The administration of the criminal justice system in the United States of America has long been under the jurisdiction of the state.  Close to half a century ago, however, federal and state governments began to modify and delegate their role of legal punishment to the private sphere.  They commenced contracting out services like vocational training,  inmate transportation,  healthcare provision,  and the like. These quickly turned into outsourcing the “complete management and operation of entire prisons”  that employed convicts as sources of cheap labor for “rehabilitative” purposes.  For example, companies like “IBM, Boeing, Motorola, Microsoft, AT & T, Wireless, Texas Instrument, Dell, Compaq, Honeywell, Hewlett-Packard, Nortel, Lucent Technologies, 3Com, Intel, Northern Telecom, TWA, Nordstrom’s, Revlon, Macy’s, Pierre Cardin, and Target” even established their own manufacturing lines inside of private prisons to use the penal labor available to them.  The inmates are hired to develop sanitation measures, produce furniture, and work on golf courses and landfills, among other services, for which they are paid little to nothing.  As such, in 2010, the two largest corporate penitentiaries CoreCivic (formerly known as the Correctives Corporations of America CCA) and GEO Group (formerly known as the Wackenhut Corrections Corporation), generated an aggregate revenue of more than 2.9 billion dollars.  In so doing, they, alongside other private prisons, have formalized the Prison Industrial Complex born out of slavery.  At their very core, they have marked the inception of an institution that has perverted the principles of justice, liberty, and equality, into interests that are both racist and capitalist. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. poignantly articulated it,

Ever since the founding fathers of our nation dreamed this dream, America has manifested a schizophrenic personality. She has been torn between [two] selves – a self in which she has proudly professed democracy and a self in which she has sadly practiced the antithesis of democracy. Slavery and segregation have been strange paradoxes in a nation founded on the principle that all men are created equal. 

This assault on human rights and civil liberties has subjected African Americans to the daily heartbreak of a broken promise for close to 250 years. In what follows, I will offer substantial philosophical and pragmatic analyses of the history and sociopolitical climate of the United States of America to illustrate various conceptions of the criminal justice system. Ultimately, I argue that it is incumbent upon the U.S. to abolish private prisons and establish justice for those marginalized by its institutions. After all, as Bob Proctor posited, “accountability is the glue that ties commitment to the result.”  More specifically, “accountability is the linchpin of the correctional system.” 
The story of private prisons dates back to the birth of the United States. Our Constitution, the “supreme Law of the Land,”  is the founding document into which slavery was written, embedded, and published in the form of the 3/5ths Compromise,  the Commerce Compromise,  and the Fugitive Slave Clause.  However, even after the institution was abolished by the 13th Amendment in 1865,  “through the prison system, vestiges of slavery have persisted… built into the abolition was state authorization to use prison labor as a bridge between slavery and paid work.”  It was ended “except as a punishment for crime.”  This “loophole” stipulation  provided white “Redeemers” (plantation owners, small farmers, and political leaders) with sufficient legal backing to rebuild the “pre-emancipation racial order” in a twofold manner: first, by effecting laws that curbed African Americans’ access to representation in governmental institutions;  and secondly, by establishing Black Codes that substantially raised the sanctions for menial “crimes”  like vagrancy,  interracial relationships,  liquor distribution,  loitering,  and public drunkenness.  It was only a matter of time before prison populations soared,  and chattel slavery was reinvented in the form of penal labor, i.e., “involuntary servitude.”  During the Reconstruction Era from 1863 to 1877, states across the U.S. began to lease out convicts for their labor, including Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Arkansas.  In 1871, the Virginia Supreme Court ruling officiated this control in Ruffin v. Commonwealth:

For the time, during his term of service in the penitentiary, he is in a state of penal servitude to the State. He has, as a consequence of his crime, not only forfeited his liberty, but all his personal rights except those which the law in its humanity accords to him. He is for the time being a slave of the State. He is civiliter mortus; and his estate, if he has any, is administered like that of a dead man. 

Even after these practices faded, Jim Crow laws were instituted under Segregation.  They contributed to the same end of mass incarceration, decimating African American families in the process.  In so doing, morally unexploitable human beings were subverted into exploitable inmates such that state prisons back then (and private corporations today) could “extract surplus value for negligible wages.”  As such, the Prison Industrial Complex “can best be understood by explicating the interlocking nature of two dual systems of oppression: capitalism and racial domination.” 
Unfortunately, the aforementioned mechanisms of persecution did not end there, and can be further contextualized through Legal Realism, a form of analytical jurisprudence that advocates an empirical approach to understanding law grounded in sociology and politics.  This approach proposes that law is a “product of decisions made by courts, law enforcement, and attorneys.”  A pragmatic analysis of Critical Race Theory is in order, to explain how such judicial decisions are made and by extension, what incarceration statistics really reveal. Derrick Bell argues in Racial Realism, that an impartial and fair legal system does not exist in the United States of America.  He suggests that judgments, especially in the criminal justice system, are made based on personal values instead of by rules or reason or even legal principles.  Bell proposes that

Black people will never gain full equality in this country. Even those herculean efforts we hail as successful will produce no more than temporary “peaks of progress,” short-lived victories that slide into irrelevance as racial patterns adapt in ways that maintain white dominance. This is a hard-to-accept fact that all history verifies. We must acknowledge it and move on to adopt policies based on what I call: “Racial Realism.” This mindset or philosophy requires us to acknowledge the permanence of our subordinate status. That acknowledgment enables us to avoid despair and frees us to imagine and implement racial strategies that can bring fulfillment and even triumph. 

By this discriminatory standard that he articulates, African Americans and other minorities are treated as “guilty until proven innocent.”  This occurs even though the Sixth Amendment  and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  to the U.S. Constitution grant a presumption of innocence to all citizens. If you want an example of this, simply look to the role that racial profiling plays in criminal convictions.  Racial profiling has led to numerous recorded false arrests and wrongful convictions: African Americans only constitute 13 percent of the American population,  but innocent black defendants constitute 47 percent of the 1900 exonerations listed in the National Registry of Exonerations.  Even worse, comparatively speaking, is the fact that minorities are overrepresented in private prisons, which is a consequence of “finely tailored contractual provisions that implicitly exempt private prison companies from housing certain types of individuals whose health care and staffing costs disproportionately attenuate profit margins.”  In other words, capitalist mechanisms of punishment “cherry pick” the healthiest and most active convicts to avoid increasing their expenditure on healthcare, exploiting them to achieve greater profits.  Thus, we can see that there are systemic structures that make it possible to discriminate against African Americans and other minority groups in underlying ways, shapes, and forms.  As such, “racism [can exist] without racists.” 
It is for this reason that from 1968 after the end of the Civil Rights Movement, until 2008, under former President Barack Obama’s Administration, the United States of America witnessed the horrors of the War on Drugs.  This period was marked by “actions taken and legislation enacted by the federal government to curb the production, distribution, and use of illicit drugs.”  The War on Drugs created mass incarceration,  disenfranchisement,   and the opioid epidemic,  while criminalizing African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and other minorities on the one hand, and medically treating European Americans on the other.  In effect, it signed out minorities from the social contract, whose protection it was supposed to have been established for.  From a purely statistical standpoint, one in three African American men will have been through the criminal justice system before they turn 30,  even though white and black individuals use drugs at almost exactly the same rates.  Further, despite the proportion of white individuals in the U.S. is five times that of black individuals,  African Americans make up 62 percent of drug convicts,  and their likelihood of being charged with drug-related crimes is 57 times more than that of white people.  Even worse, prisons across the U.S. release more than 600,000 individuals each year, with local jails releasing an additional nine million.  Two-thirds of former felons are re-charged within three years of their release, more than half of whom are re-incarcerated.  This process of “previously convicted criminals reoffending and reentering the prison system is known as recidivism… [which] clogs the criminal justice system,”  and former convicts fall back in the prison-to-life-to-prison pipeline.  As Ray elucidates, “People always talk about ‘bad apples.’ Well, bad apples come from rotten trees – law enforcement agencies imbued with structural racism.” 
To better understand the rationale underlying these occurrences, an examination of the War on Drugs’ history is in order. In the early 1970s, upon former President Richard Nixon’s election, a series of policies tackling the drug problem in the U.S. were effected.  These range from the passage of the Controlled Substances Act  (“statute under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use, and distribution of certain substances is regulated” ) and the creation of the Drug Enforcement Agency (“federal law enforcement agency under the Department of Justice tasked with combating drug trafficking and distribution” ), to the draconian Rockefeller Mandatory Minimum Drug Laws, which went to the extent of imprisoning low-level dealers and users with life sentences.  What’s particularly notable about this is that the drug problem was negligible at the time,  so the question regarding why such policies were implemented is significant to consider. In 1994, John Ehrlichman, Counsel and Assistant to President Nixon on Domestic Affairs, confessed:

The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. Do you understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did. 

This is crucial not only because it implies that the War on Drugs was initiated for the sole purpose of vilifying African Americans, but also because it was the root of decades of sociological problems such as mass incarceration in the community. Former President Ronald Reagan followed this criminalization in the 80s with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which went on to impose harsh penalties like the sentence for the Administration of crack being far more than that of cocaine.  The Act outlined a 100:1 ratio in sentence terms for crack versus powder cocaine even though they are chemically exactly the same.  The suggested distinction is derived from their usage: crack was associated by the public and media with black America, while powder cocaine with white America.  Former President George Bush I continued this trend with his campaign of being “tough on crime” in the late 80s.  However, the worst was yet to come: in the 90s, under former President Bill Clinton’s administration, policies like “Stop and Frisk” and no-knock warrants were permitted,  which exacerbated the racial profiling of African Americans.  This punitive approach to drug policy has gradually contributed to the disintegration of our democracy, with Courts ruling in opposition to the Fourth Amendment rights granted to citizens by the Constitution.  Police engagement in wiretapping, surveillance, undercover operations, paying informants, and entrapping dealers by offering to buy or sell drugs,  all infringe upon individuals’ freedom from unwarranted searches and seizures. 
Notably, policies like “One Strike and You’re Out,” regarding the housing eviction of criminals perpetuated the cycle of poverty African Americans were facing.  Without voting rights or access to food, shelter, clothing, education, and employment, successful reentry into society became close to impossible for the formerly incarcerated.  Such persecution forced minority children in particular to grow up in such institutions with a lower rate of upward social mobility, and they became unable to access as many academic and professional opportunities as they would otherwise have been able to.  The War on Drugs was thus a mechanism by way of which “proponents of racial hierarchy found that they could install a new racial caste system,” posited legal scholar Michelle Alexander. 
Still, perhaps the most damaging consequence of the War on Drugs was the privatization of prisons in the 80s.  Public prisons were increasingly becoming overcrowded with the burgeoning incarcerated population, and rising costs began to infringe upon the government’s ability to exact punishment efficiently.  However, for many political theorists, “a crucial part of the raison d’etre of the state” is the administration of the criminal justice system,  where:

Punishment has been seen as a state function in order to limit if not eliminate the influence of private interests over the detection, trial, and sanctioning of lawbreakers – in short, to ensure that all individuals are treated equally before the law. In theory we strive to create institutions and procedures that punish all and only those who have broken the criminal law. 

This approach is “forward-looking,”  and seeks to define justice as both rehabilitative and retributionist, as Enlightenment political philosopher John Locke does.  In paragraph 8 of his seminal work, the Second Treatise of Civil Government, Locke posits that one’s crimes must be punished in a manner that “is proportionate to his transgression, which is so much as may serve for reparation and restraint.”  For John Locke, the purpose of reparations is to make amends for the wrongdoing committed.  More importantly, restraint serves a twofold objective, the first of which is to deter the person who committed the crime from recommitting the offense;  the second purpose being the deterrence of others from committing similar crimes.  
  Here, the problem with private prisons is that they introduce a “seductive”  but “perverse” incentive  to profit off of exploitation into the social contract, conflicting with and thereby thwarting the fairness  and equality that the justice system is predicated upon, namely

… corporate governance principles and goals of profit maximization for shareholders; executive compensation based on profits and share price; forward-looking statements forecasting more robust prison populations; and increased profit levels built almost solely on human misery and degradation. 

It is exactly financial motives like these that German economic philosopher Karl Marx condemned in his seminal work, the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, where he outlines several important critiques of the capitalist system.  Marx’s philosophical justification is grounded in the means of production created through capitalism via the proletariat, and the necessary component of greed and arbitrary hierarchies that support its maintenance.  Through the system, he makes the distinction between the bourgeois and proletariat, i.e., the elites and laborers: the bourgeois are political and economic elites who exploit the hard-working proletariat.  Contemporary Marxist scholar Mark Jay holds that private prisons are “mechanisms of bourgeois control that work to contain, stigmatize, and exploit immiserated and recalcitrant workers.”  Under this view, the legal system is designed to uphold capitalist ideals by increasing the already enormous gulf between the politically powerful wealthy and the marginalized poor, effectively perpetuating the cycle of impotence for the latter: 

… the state in its repressive mode appears as the savior of the social order, rather than as the mechanism by which the inherent disorder of capitalist social relations is given institutional form. 

This is evident from the demographics of inmates:  over 50 percent were not employed full-time when they were arrested,  two-thirds grew up in households whose annual income was less than half the poverty line,  and minorities were disproportionately overrepresented.  When such odds stand against entire communities of people, the application of criminal laws in adjudicating guilt must be subject to strict scrutiny.  Given that the poor possess the least power over the conditions of their labor, the claim that citizens of all socioeconomic classes are afforded an equal opportunity to be law-abiding is debatable.  Thus, it is important that this lens be employed in interpreting the moral status of private prisons. As the American Bar Association’s Task Force on the Privatization of Corrections articulated in Resolution 115B, “the imposition and implementation of a sentence of incarceration for a criminal offense is a core function of government… and there is a strong public interest in having prison and jail systems in which lines of accountability are clear.” 
For this reason, a subtle distinction that is perhaps predominantly symbolic but nevertheless significant must be drawn between the public sphere and the private. In the case of the former, penitentiary staff simply earn a living doing their jobs.  Conversely, in the latter case, not only do penitentiary staff earn a living by supervising the spaces, but there also exist high-level executives who stand to earn a profit proportional to the efficient performance of the facility.  So, what does this profit incentive entail, and how do private prison administrators earn said profit? The U.S. federal government pays corporations like CoreCivic a stipend basis the number of inmates they house.  As previously described, the purpose of a prison is to deter individuals from recommitting offences, and reforming their actions.  By extension, if this purpose is effectively carried out, crime and recidivism rates should decline respectively.  However, a reduction in recidivism and crime rates is actually bad business for the corporations that run private prisons.  This is because they foreground low operational costs in their management decision-making: “large and predictable revenue streams are crucial for corporate health and vitality.”  To be sure, doing so includes but is not limited to cutting educational opportunities for prisoners, understaffing facilities, and lowering the quality of proven rehabilitation programs.  It is evident, then, that profit incentives have a “corrupt[ing]” influence on individuals, which reverberate onto entire institutions plagued by these practices.  Further, lobbyists of the Prison Industrial Complex work to increase shareholders’ and executives’ profits by

(1) influencing carceral policy so that larger numbers of U.S. residents face incarceration; (2) exploiting individuals locked up through private prison labor contracts; (3) lobbying elected government officials to privatize entire state and federal prison systems and increase prison populations; (4) diminishing the quality of food and degree of safety for prisoners in order to cut costs at privately run facilities; (5) drafting legislation and lobbying elected legislators for passage of draconian sentencing guidelines including three-strikes and you’re out, mandatory minimums, and illegal immigration detention legislation; (6) bribing judges to fill private prison facilities with children on questionable charges; (7) requiring governments and municipalities that contract for their services to maintain capacity in their private prison facilities at 90% or in some contracts 100%; and (8) building new prisons despite no government contract or inmates to fill them. 

  In addition, Marx suggests that the cycle of production within private prisons generates capital, i.e., property resulting in the exploitation of wage-labor.  This is maintained by the alienation of the proletariat who, in this case, are the inmates, in four forms: from their product, their productive activity, their essential qualities as part of the human species, and ultimately “the estrangement of man from man.”  Thus, in this conception, Marx avidly protests capitalism on the grounds that it dehumanizes individuals, and devalues their labor.  He advocates for the government seizing private property that contributes to said exploitation and estrangement.  In the case at hand, when institutions built on the backs of slaves like private prisons are left to the whims of the capitalist market, convicts, whose rationality and autonomy necessitate their being treated as universal ends, are instead commodified into means to an end. 
To be sure, private prisons exist at the nexus of capitalism and racial discrimination. They are morally illegitimate mechanisms to administer the role of the criminal justice system, and fail to uphold the principles on which the United States is founded: justice, liberty, and equality. By extension, under this view, it would necessarily be incumbent upon the U.S. to abolish private prisons and establish justice for those marginalized by its institutions.
